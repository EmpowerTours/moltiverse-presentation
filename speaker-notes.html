    <div class="say-block">"What if I told you that right now &mdash; today &mdash; students with no coding background are building real products using AI and winning serious money?"</div>

    <div class="say-block">"Web3 means you can own your digital creations &mdash; not just post them on someone else's platform."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"And hackathons? Companies don't care about your GPA anymore. They want to see what you've shipped. Hackathons are where portfolios are built and careers start."</div>

    <div class="say-block">"Moltiverse is a hackathon happening right now &mdash; February 2nd through the 18th. Two weeks. And the prize pool is two hundred thousand dollars."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"The challenge: build autonomous AI agents on the Monad blockchain. These are AI programs that can make transactions, build communities, and generate value &mdash; on their own."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"There are two tracks. The Agent plus Token track has $140K in prizes &mdash; you build an AI agent AND launch a token. The Agent track is $60K &mdash; pure development, no token required."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"You can enter solo or in a team. Any experience level. You do NOT need a crypto background. The organizers provide starter kits and run weekly workshops."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"The website is moltiverse.dev &mdash; write it down, save it, visit it tonight."</div>

  </div>
  <div class="slide-body">
    <div class="section-label say">What To Say</div>
    <div class="say-block">"Think about it: $10K for a project built in two weeks. That's more than most summer internships pay in total."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"But even if you don't win money, you walk away with real skills: AI agent development, smart contracts, blockchain. These are the most in-demand skills in tech right now."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"You get a portfolio piece that actually matters. Not a to-do app &mdash; a real AI agent that runs on a real blockchain."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"And you connect with builders from around the world. Some of the best companies in Web3 were born at hackathons."</div>

    <div class="section-label say">What To Say</div>
    <div class="say-block">"This is EmpowerTours &mdash; something I built. Not a team of 20 engineers. One person, using AI tools, building on the Monad blockchain."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"It has Passport NFTs &mdash; digital stamps for countries you visit, stored on-chain forever. A live radio system where artists earn 70% of revenue. GPS-locked travel experiences created by locals. And a DAO where the community votes on everything."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"The point isn't about EmpowerTours specifically &mdash; it's that this kind of product is now buildable by students. The tools exist. The platforms exist. You just have to start."</div>

    <div class="section-label say">What To Say</div>
    <div class="say-block">"There's a new kind of developer emerging. They're called vibe coders."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"Vibe coding means you describe what you want to build in natural language, and AI tools like Claude, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot help you write the code."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"You don't need to memorize syntax. You don't need years of experience. You need to understand what you want to build and be willing to iterate."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"The best advice I can give you: build ugly first. Don't wait until you know everything. Ship something, get feedback, improve it. That's how real products get made."</div>

    <div class="section-label delivery">Delivery Notes</div>
    <ul class="notes-list">
      <li>This is the <strong>empowerment moment</strong> &mdash; students should feel like they can actually do this</li>

    <div class="say-block">"Step two: join the Discord. This is where the community lives &mdash; you can find teammates, ask questions, get help."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"Step three: pick your track. If you want to experiment with tokens, go Agent+Token. If you just want to build an AI agent, the Agent track is cleaner."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"Step four: use the starter kits. The organizers have built templates and tools to help you get going fast. And there are weekly workshops."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"Step five: submit early. Moltiverse uses rolling submissions with early feedback &mdash; you don't have to wait until the deadline. Ship something rough and iterate."</div>

    <div class="say-block">"A DeFi agent that manages investment portfolios automatically. A gaming AI that plays blockchain games, earns tokens, and makes trades. A community agent that curates content and grows a following. A world-building agent that creates interactive experiences."</div>
    <div class="say-block">"But honestly? The best idea is the one nobody in this room has thought of yet. That's the magic of hackathons &mdash; they produce ideas that nobody predicted."</div>

    <div class="section-label delivery">Delivery Notes</div>
    <ul class="notes-list">
      <li>Go through ideas quickly &mdash; they're sparks, not deep-dives</li>

<!-- ===== Q&A SECTION ===== -->
<div class="slide-notes">
  <div class="slide-header">
    <h2>Q&A Quick Reference</h2>
    <span class="timing">Q&A</span>
  </div>
  <div class="slide-body">
    <p style="color:var(--text-dim);margin-bottom:1.2rem;font-size:0.9rem;">Top 12 predicted questions with short answers.</p>

    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>1. "I don't know how to code. Can I still participate?"</h4>
      <p>Yes. AI tools like Claude and Cursor can help you write code from natural language descriptions. The starter kits handle a lot of boilerplate. Many winners at hackathons are beginners who learn fast.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>2. "What is Monad?"</h4>
      <p>A high-performance blockchain &mdash; think of it as a super-fast, cheap version of Ethereum. 10,000 transactions per second. EVM-compatible, so existing tools work with it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>3. "What's an AI agent?"</h4>
      <p>An AI program that can take actions autonomously &mdash; make transactions, post content, manage funds, interact with other agents. It's AI that does things, not just answers questions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>4. "Do I need to buy crypto to participate?"</h4>
      <p>No. The hackathon provides what you need to build on testnet. You don't need to invest any money.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>5. "Can I participate from anywhere?"</h4>
      <p>Yes. Moltiverse is fully remote and global. Everything happens on Discord and online.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>6. "What if I don't finish in time?"</h4>
      <p>Submit what you have. Rolling submissions mean you get early feedback. An incomplete but interesting project is better than no submission at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>7. "How is vibe coding different from regular coding?"</h4>
      <p>Traditional coding: you memorize syntax and type everything. Vibe coding: you describe what you want in plain language, AI generates the code, you review and refine. It's faster but you still need to understand what you're building.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>8. "What tools do I need?"</h4>
      <p>A laptop, internet connection, and free tools: Claude (AI), a code editor (VS Code or Cursor), and a crypto wallet (MetaMask). All free.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>9. "How was EmpowerTours built?"</h4>
      <p>Using AI-assisted development on the Monad blockchain. Smart contracts in Solidity, frontend in React, provably fair randomness via Pyth Entropy. One person, AI tools, and persistence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>10. "Is Web3/crypto a scam?"</h4>
      <p>There are scams in every industry. Web3 technology itself &mdash; blockchains, smart contracts, decentralized governance &mdash; is legitimate and being adopted by major institutions. Focus on building real utility, not speculation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>11. "What if I want to build a team?"</h4>
      <p>Join the Moltiverse Discord. There's a team-finding channel. Post your skills and interests, find complementary teammates. Solo is fine too.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
      <h4>12. "What happens after the hackathon?"</h4>
      <p>You keep your project, your skills, and your connections. Many hackathon projects become startups. At minimum, you have a portfolio piece and real blockchain development experience.</p>
